# Duckcards
All 120 or so cards are AI generated, as I could not be bothered to write them all myself. However, the card structure is designed by me.

When it comes to the game mechanics, I built all the components myself, using AI for help with specific functions or ideas when I got stuck. This specifically applies to the place_card Function and create_deck functions.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (latest).
3. Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install any dependencies.
4. Run main.py to start the game.
